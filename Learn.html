                <h1 style="color: royalblue;">Processor</h1>

                <p style="color: black;">A Processor, also known as a CPU (Central Processing Unit), is the brain of a computer or electronic device, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It interprets basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the program instructions. The performance of a processor is measured in terms of its clock speed (usually in GHz) and the number of cores it contains. Modern processors often come with multiple cores, allowing them to perform several tasks simultaneously, which significantly enhances multitasking and overall system performance.
                </p>
                Processors have evolved from simple single-core designs to sophisticated multi-core architectures. These advancements have enabled processors to handle more complex tasks, such as gaming, video editing, and artificial intelligence applications. Furthermore, features like hyper-threading, cache memory, and integrated graphics have contributed to the increased efficiency and speed of modern CPUs. The choice of a processor is crucial for determining a device's capability and performance, making it a key consideration for users when purchasing computers, laptops, or mobile devices.</th>

                <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of volatile memory used by computers and other devices to store data that is actively being used or processed. Unlike storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, RAM is much faster but only retains data temporarily while the device is powered on. Once the device is turned off, all data in RAM is lost. This makes RAM crucial for running applications, as it provides quick read and write access to a temporary workspace, enabling smooth and efficient performance.
                </p>
                The amount of RAM in a device affects its ability to handle multitasking and run memory-intensive applications. More RAM allows a device to manage more data simultaneously, improving performance when switching between programs or running complex software like video editing tools or games. The speed of RAM, measured in MHz, also plays a role in how quickly data can be accessed and processed, impacting the overall responsiveness of the system. Modern devices typically come with several gigabytes of RAM to support the demands of current software and operating systems.
